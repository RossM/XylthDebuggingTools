This mod adds some extra debugging conveniences for mod developers, particularly class mod developers. It is not intended for regular players.

Current features:
Enables "Sim Combat" feature in loadout screen.
Allows selection of GTS and AWC-only abilities in Tactical Quick Launch.

Usage:
I suggest you copy this from your steam mods folder to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\XCOM 2\XComGame\Mods", so that you can use it after launching via F5. If you prefer launching through Steam, use the console command "UISpawnScreen UIShell" to access the debug shell.

Compatibility:
This mod overrides UISquadSelect, UITacticalQuickLaunch_UnitAbilities, and UITacticalQuickLaunch_UnitSlot. Since you should be a mod developer if you're using this mod, I hope you know how to handle conflicts.
